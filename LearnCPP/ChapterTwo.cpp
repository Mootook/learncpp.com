/**
 * A namespace is a region that allows you to declare names inside of it
 * for the purpose of disambiguation.
 * Namespace scope - any named declared inside won't be mistaken for identical names
 * in other scopes
 *
 * Accessing namespaces:
 * with " :: ", i.e. std::cout -> cout of the standard namespace
 * "::" is called the scope resolution operator.
 * 'using namespace std' is another option which allows for the use of just 'cout'.
 * To be avoided.
 *
 * Macro defines - a macro is a rule that defines how input text is converetd into replacement output text
 *
 * "ifdef" is a preprocessor directive to check if an identifier has been "defined"
 * --> If true, the code within the ifdef and endif is compiled.
 * "ifndef" checks if something has NOT been defined.
